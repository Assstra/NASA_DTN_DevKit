**This package is a modified version of bpsource and bpsink by Scott Burleigh**
This program was tested on ION open source 3.3.1

*** NOTE ***
For the makefile to work, you need to update it with the path to your ION install

---------------------------------------------------------

	(included)

---------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

2) take the "bpi" directory and put it somewhere on all machines

---------------------------------------------------------
Source Files:
bpisend.c	-	Image stream sending program
	Usage: bpisend <src EID> <dest EID> <filename> [-flags]
	Flags:
		-c 	Disable custody
		-v 	Verbose mode, will print line numbers
		-t <ttl>	Sets TTL for bundles 

bpirecv.c	-	Image stream receiver and display program
	Usage: bpirecv <own EID>
	
lodepng.c	- 	Library used by bpisend.c
	
lodepng.h	- 	Header for lodepng.c
	
---------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues:

- If you turn on the critical forwarding bit or a bundle is duplicated
 for any reason and delivered, this will mess up bpirecv's count.  
 This will force bpirecv to close before it has all scanlines present 
 because it will have received the total amount of bundles.
