s3 - Satellite file transfer test, 4 nodes:
	- bping running on ipn:x.1 for all nodes
	- bprecvfile running on ipn:x.2 for all nodes
	- made a directory 'recv' on all nodes (for endpoint.sh)
	- endpoint.sh running in bg on startup for all nodes
		- takes all testfiles and moves them to the recv directory
		- eliminates clutter and puts all files in one place
		- runs on a faster interval than report.sh
	- report.sh running in bg on startup for node 4 (satellite)
		- sends the current date to $dest after an interval
		- logs to send.log
		- files will appear as testfileX on the dest machine
