base - standard model, 4 nodes.  mission control, link, ground station, and satellite.  chain of 4
diamond - a 4 node ring.  connection alternates between N2-N4 and N3-N4.  
gsfc - mockup of the GSFC.  high bandwidth down from the satellite but low bandwith from ground to MCC
mars - simulation of a mars lander taking to earth via an intermittently connected mars orbiter and DSN
miss - a modified version of planet.  the satellite misses a connection to demonstrate a potential weakness in CGR
planet - star topology, 5 outer node mockup of a planet.  one satellite orbits.  only 2 nodes have uplink
small - two outer disconnected nodes and one messenger.  the messenger moves back and forth providing connectivity
square - 3x3 grid, all connectivity all the time.  for routing algorithm testing.

samples - CORE sample configs
